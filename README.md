In this lab we have implemented the Normal Matrix multiplication and Strassen Matrix multiplication.
Both are implemented using the vectors in c++. Both the multiplications are implemented in source file.
To run the code simply execute the source file.
It will ask for the options select the option, 1 for Normal and 2 for Strassen respectively.
